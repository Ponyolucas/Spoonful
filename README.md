# Spoonful
Project Name: Spoonful

Application Description: Everyone needs a to do list to get done with the things that they need to do in the day. However, motivation, disability, other issues, or a combination of these factors can make some days harder than others. Spoonful seeks to first contextualize how it's user is feeling during the day, before suggesting a more manageable list of tasks to get done so its user still takes advantage of their time and feels good about whatever progress they may make while not overwhelming them with the vastness of what they might need to do. It's a task manager that's designed with empathy first.

Features + Tools/Technologies: Describe the functionalities of the app. For each feature, mention the tools/technologies that you may need to implement this feature.

1. an input option that asks how the user is feeling/ how many spoons they feel they have that day
2. A quiz to find out an estimate of how many spoons you might be at
3. An editable task list where a user can add a task and how many spoons it might take
4. A bar with the number of spoons that depletes after a task is deemed complete
5. A celebration message/ maybe animation once all the spoons are used up
6. A way to easily show family/friends/teachers/bosses progress, to educate those unfamiliar with spoon theory about it.
