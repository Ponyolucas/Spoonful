    <h1>What is Spoon Theory?</h1>
    <p>We all wake up with a certain amount of energy, but for some people, that energy is limited in a way that isn’t always visible. Spoon Theory is a metaphor that helps explain what it’s like to live with that limitation, especially for people managing chronic illness, disability, mental health challenges, or neurodivergence.</p>

    <p>The idea is simple: imagine you start your day with a handful of spoons. Each task: getting dressed, answering a message, cooking a meal, going to class — costs a spoon. When you run out, you’re done. You can’t borrow spoons from tomorrow without consequences.</p>
        
    <p>For those who live with chronic fatigue, anxiety, depression, or other conditions, this metaphor isn’t just symbolic; it’s reality. This reality involves having to plan every step with intention. Not because of laziness. Not because of an inherent lack of. But because their spoons are finite.</p>
        
    <p>This project is about learning to see those spoons, in ourselves and in others. It's about developing empathy, communicating more openly about needs, and recognizing that everyone’s daily capacity looks a little different. Sometimes radically so.</p>
        
    <p>If you’ve never thought about your energy this way, that’s okay. This isn’t just for people who identify as spoonies, it’s for anyone trying to better understand the rhythms of care, fatigue, and capacity that shape how we move through the world.</p>
